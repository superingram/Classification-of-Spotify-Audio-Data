# Classification-of-Spotify-Audio-Data

     Streaming services like Spotify and Pandora have become very popular as a means of listening to favorite styles of music and to discover new artists that produce music with similar styles.  This project will classify tracks into either ‘Rock’ or “Hip-Hop’ based on a number of features using a Decision Tree algorithm and a Logistic Regression algorithm.  The data will first be normalized so that principal component analysis (PCA) can be used.  Then, the data will be balanced with sampling and the two algorithms will be compared after implementing k-fold cross validation.
